##### This solution enables enterprises to process, analyze, and manage real-time data from thousands of RFID devices and sensors at the edge before selectively pushing valuable insights to the cloud. By way of concise description, the platform is an edge computing architecture for cost optimization and scalable proceesing of massive streaming data from IoT devices




## Critical Enterprise Value Propositions

* Massive-Scale Real-time Analytics
  
* 10,000+ concurrent device handling with demonstrated processing of 5+ million records

* Sub-second latency from edge to analytics-ready data

* Enterprise-grade reliability with zero data loss architecture

* Scalable Kafka-based streaming that grows with your IoT deployment

### <ins>Key Advantage</ins>: Process terabytes of raw sensor data locally, then send only kilobytes of business intelligence to the cloud, thereby reducing:

* Cloud infrastructure costs by 60-80%

* Data egress charges through intelligent filtering

* Network bandwidth requirements

* Cloud processing expenses
