This is a high-performance, batched stream ingestor that consumes IoT events from Kafka and persists them to a PostgreSQL database using optimized batch operations.


Architecture & Design Patterns:

Dual-Topic Consumption: It runs two independent Kafka consumers in parallel (asyncio.gather) for temperature and price topics, maintaining separation of concerns and allowing each stream to be processed at its own rate.


Batch Processing for High Throughput:

Size-Based Batching: Uses BATCH_SIZE (default: 1000) to accumulate messages until reaching an optimal bulk insert size

Time-Based Batching: Uses BATCH_TIMEOUT (default: 1 second) as a fallback to ensure data isn't delayed too long during low-throughput periods

This batching dramatically reduces database round-trips and improves I/O efficiency



Database Optimization:

Connection Pooling: Uses asyncpg.Pool with 5-20 connections to handle concurrent database operations efficiently

Bulk Inserts: Uses executemany() for batched SQL execution, which is significantly faster than individual inserts

Transaction Management: Wraps each batch in a transaction for atomicity and performance



Data Processing Pipeline:

text
Kafka Message → JSON Parsing → Timestamp Conversion → Batch Accumulation → Bulk Database Insert

The timestamp conversion from ISO format to PostgreSQL-native datetime objects is crucial for proper time-series querying

Error handling at each stage prevents single bad messages from breaking the entire pipeline



Scalability Features:

Consumer Groups: Each consumer uses a different group_id, allowing for horizontal scaling - you could run multiple instances of this service

Asynchronous I/O: Uses asyncpg and aiokafka for non-blocking database and Kafka operations

Configurable Parameters: All key parameters (batch size, timeout, connection settings) are environment-configurable


  
Why This Matters for IoT:
In real IoT deployments with thousands of devices generating data continuously, this batched approach is essential for:

Handling data spikes without overwhelming the database

Reducing storage latency while maintaining throughput

Cost efficiency through optimal resource utilization

Reliable data persistence with proper error handling

This consumer represents the "T" in ETL - it's responsible for efficiently loading streaming IoT data into a structured storage system where it can be queried, analyzed, and visualized.
